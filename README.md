# Agito

A blazinlgy fast Dungeons and Dragons character creator for Android, Windows, and Web.

## Getting Started

This application is still currently in active development, so it cannot be used by the public currently. Stay tuned!

## Features
- Simple, on device character storage
- A guide on how to create your first D&D character for people who are new to the game
- The ability to import characters from D&D Beyond (ew) and WorldAnvil.
- A pretty user interface, built for the modern D&D player.

## Planned Features
- I want to add a way to have sprites and little animations when certain things are done in the app. 
- Cloud storage of the characters, so they can be accessed from any device
